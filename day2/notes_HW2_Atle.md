# Homework Numpy Arrays Review

"How many total values are in this array?"

- How many values are there in total in this array.

"How many bytes does this array take up?"
- Have they actually learned the nbytes method anywhere before this?

"**The square of the values 40, 20, 3, 5, and 10.**"
- The solution is taking the square root while the task test says find the square.

"How many bytes does this array take up?  Why?"

- Should rather be "Why is it this exact number of bytes?". Also, there hasn't been anything about number of bytes in the earlier exercises.

The exercises are repeated at the bottom.
