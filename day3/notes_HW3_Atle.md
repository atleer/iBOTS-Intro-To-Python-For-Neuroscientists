# HW 3 Pandas MentalRotation

"What was the median reaction time across all subjects?"
    - "reaction time" seems to be from previous exercises. In this dataset it's just called 'Time'.

- "What was the **average** response time for subject 12 on trials with an Angle of 50? (Hint: `(A) & (B)`)"
    - Note: The solution gives the median here.

- "Is there a response time difference between matching and nonmatching
trials?"
    - There's no solution for this task. You can do it with a logreg, but the students haven't been introduced to scipy or other scientific libraries yet, so it seems odd to require the students to answer this question.


"Is there a **correlation** between Angle of mental rotation and response time?  Visualize the relationship using a scatter plot"
    - "Is there an **association/relationship**..." instead. You don't answer the original question by a visualization alone.

## Plotting with Seaborn

- They haven't learned Seaborn before these exercises, have they?
