# Notes to material for day one

## 1) Python types

- Object-oriented - data &rarr; code
    - Built-in functions

- Check types

    - Make data variables of different types: int, float, string, bytes

- **Typo** in solutions: Tur `data2` into an int, from `data1` (What happened?); data1 = 5.2
    - This is also repetition. Exactly same as earlier task. Could be sensible to mention - otherwise "what happened" might be confusing since they might expect something else to happen than same as before.
- **Typo:** Make `data2`, a string, from `data1` and Make `data2`, a bytes, from `data1`.
    - Should not be commas here.
- "How many don't start with an underscore?" Write do **not**.
- For the task: "Looking at the list of methods in `dir(int)`, would you assume that you use the addition operator with integers?" The answer is already given.

- Method Syntax in Python
    - Dunder methods: ``__add__``
        - Not meant to be used directly
    - Normal methods
    - ``.`` after object
    - ``dir()`` to see all methods of an object`
    - Try using the different methods.
        - Also see what happens when you try to use a method that doesn't exist for that type.

- Review Terminology
    - What are the following things called? Function, method, or operator?
