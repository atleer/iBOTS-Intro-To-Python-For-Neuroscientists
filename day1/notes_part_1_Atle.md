# Notes to material for day one

## 1) Python types

- Object-oriented - data &rarr; code
    - Built-in functions

- Check types

    - Make data variables of different types: int, float, string, bytes

- Method Syntax in Python
    - Dunder methods: ``__add__``
        - Not meant to be used directly
    - Normal methods
    - ``.`` after object
    - ``dir()`` to see all methods of an object`
    - Try using the different methods.
        - Also see what happens when you try to use a method that doesn't exist for that type.

- Review Terminology
    - What are the following things called? Function, method, or operator?
