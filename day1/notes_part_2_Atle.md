# Strings and methods

## Intro to strings and polymorphism

- Built-in string operations, functions, and methods
    - Count, slicing/accessing, upper, split

- They don't get examples for a lot of these operations/methods. Is the intention that they should look up which methods strings have and figure it out that way?

### Text files

- Read and write to file
    - Using .read() and .write(something) methods

- Get, read, and do things with online text
    - using urllib.request
